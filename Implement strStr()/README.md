# Implement strStr().

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1


# Constraints:

- 1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 10⁴
- haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.
